#  acad@print

Formats a webpage like an academic essay when it is printed, through the use of `@page` and CSS Media Queries.

12pt times, double-spaced, page numbers in the top-right, 1in margins, all that fun stuff.

Doesn't affect screen display at all, but wipes anything in the following pseudo-elements when you print:

- html::before
- html::after
- body::before

Headers and footers require support for `columns`.

##  Usage:

Just include `style.css` in the webpage.

You can set metadata on the `<body>` element to add a header to your document:
- `data-acad-author`
- `data-acad-date`
â€“ `data-acad-professor`
- `data-acad-course`

`<aside>s`, `<nav>s`, and any element with the attribute `data-acad-hidden` will not be displayed.
